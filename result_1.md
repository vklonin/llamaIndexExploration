## Project Overview

The Chess Analysis Tool is a software application designed to analyze chess positions and provide analysis results. It connects to the Ricpa chess engine and uses various algorithms and strategies to determine the best move for a given position. The tool is intended to assist chess players in improving their game by providing insights and recommendations for their moves.

## Installation

To install and set up the Chess Analysis Tool, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository from GitHub: `git clone https://github.com/username/project.git`
2. Install the required dependencies by running `npm install`
3. Set up the Ricpa chess engine by following the instructions provided in the engine's documentation
4. Configure the application settings by editing the `config.js` file and providing the necessary parameters, such as the engine's connection details and API keys
5. Start the application by running `npm start`

Note: This project requires Node.js and npm to be installed on your machine.

## Usage

To use the Chess Analysis Tool, follow these steps:

1. Open the application in your web browser by navigating to `http://localhost:3000`
2. Enter a chess position in the provided input field, either in FEN notation or by using the interactive chessboard
3. Click the "Analyze" button to initiate the analysis process
4. Wait for the analysis to complete, and the tool will display the recommended move and additional analysis information
5. Explore the various features and options provided by the tool, such as viewing the analysis queue, managing the chessbase, and tracking usage statistics

Here is an example of how to use the tool:

```
1. Enter the following FEN position: rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1
2. Click the "Analyze" button
3. Wait for the analysis to complete
4. The tool will display the recommended move and analysis information, such as the evaluation score and suggested variations
5. Explore other features, such as managing the analysis queue or optimizing the chessbase
```

## Project Classes

The Chess Analysis Tool consists of the following classes:

- `RicpaClient`: Used to connect to the Ricpa chess engine and provides methods for sending and receiving data from the engine.
- `QueueProcessor`: Responsible for processing the analysis queue using the evaluation, evaluationSources, analyzer, and strategy modules.
- `ExternalEvaluation`: Used to read and store external evaluations from a file.
- `QueueProcessingStrategy`: Responsible for determining the best move for a given position using the pgnAnalyzer and baseProvider modules.
- `RequestProcessor`: Handles requests from clients and uses the baseManager, queueProcessor, usageStatistics, and analyzer modules to process requests.
- `Analyzer`: Analyzes positions and provides analysis results by sending and receiving data from the Ricpa engine using the ricpaClient and pingUrl.
- `BaseManager`: Manages the chessbase by providing methods for reading, indexing, and optimizing the chessbase.
- `DepthSelector`: Sets the default depth for analysis.
- `PgnAnalyzer`: Analyzes PGN files and determines the best move for a given position.
- `Queue`: Manages the analysis queue by providing methods for adding, removing, and retrieving items from the queue.
- `Synchronizer`: Saves and loads the analysis queue.
- `UsageStatistics`: Tracks usage statistics.
- `UsageStatisticsSynchronizer`: Synchronizes usage statistics with a remote server.
- `Api`: Registers the request processor and listens for requests on the specified port.

## API Endpoints

The Chess Analysis Tool provides the following API endpoints:

- `/api/fenbase`: Retrieves the FEN base data. Example input: `{ url: '/api/fenbase' }`. Example output: `{ fenBase: [{...}, {...}, ...] }`.
- `/api/ping`: Pings the server to check its status. Example input: `{ url: '/api/ping' }`. Example output: `{ status: 'OK' }`.
- `/api/userscount`: Retrieves the count of users. Example input: `{ url: '/api/userscount' }`. Example output: `{ count: 42 }`.
- `/api/analyze`: Analyzes a chess position and provides analysis results. Example input: `{ url: '/api/analyze', fen: 'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1' }`. Example output: `{ analysis: {...} }`.
- `/api/base`: Retrieves the chessbase data. Example input: `{ url: '/api/base' }`. Example output: `{ base: [{...}, {...}, ...] }`.
- `/api/fendata`: Retrieves data for a specific FEN position. Example input: `{ url: '/api/fendata', fen: 'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1' }`. Example output: `{ data: {...} }`.
- `/api/unsupported`: Returns an error message for unsupported API calls. Example input: `{ url: '/api/unsupported' }`. Example output: `{ error: 'Unsupported API call' }`.
