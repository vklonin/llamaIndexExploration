## Project Overview

The Chess Analysis Tool is a software application designed to analyze chess positions and provide analysis results. It connects to the Ricpa chess engine and uses various modules and classes to process analysis requests, manage the analysis queue, and provide the best move for a given position. The tool is intended to assist chess players in improving their game by providing in-depth analysis and insights.

## Installation

To install and set up the Chess Analysis Tool, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository from GitHub: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/chess-analysis-tool.git`
2. Install the required dependencies by running `npm install` in the project directory.
3. Set up the Ricpa chess engine by following the instructions provided by the engine's documentation.
4. Configure the application by modifying the configuration file `config.js` to specify the necessary parameters such as the Ricpa engine URL and other settings.
5. Start the application by running `npm start` in the project directory.

Note: Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your system before proceeding with the installation.

## Usage

To use the Chess Analysis Tool, follow these steps:

1. Open a web browser and navigate to the application's URL.
2. Register or log in to your account.
3. Use the provided interface to input a chess position in FEN notation or upload a PGN file.
4. Submit the analysis request.
5. Wait for the analysis to complete.
6. View the analysis results, including the best move, evaluation, and suggested variations.
7. Explore additional features such as accessing the chessbase, viewing usage statistics, and managing the analysis queue.

Here is an example of how to use the Chess Analysis Tool:

1. Open the application in your web browser.
2. Log in to your account or create a new one.
3. Enter a chess position in FEN notation or upload a PGN file.
4. Click the "Analyze" button to submit the analysis request.
5. Wait for the analysis to complete.
6. Once the analysis is finished, the best move, evaluation, and suggested variations will be displayed.
7. You can also access the chessbase, view usage statistics, and manage the analysis queue through the provided interface.

## Project Classes

### RicpaClient

The `RicpaClient` class is used to connect to the Ricpa chess engine. It provides methods for sending and receiving data from the engine.

### QueueProcessor

The `QueueProcessor` class is responsible for processing the analysis queue. It uses the evaluation, evaluationSources, analyzer, and strategy to process the queue.

### ExternalEvaluation

The `ExternalEvaluation` class is used to read and store external evaluations from a file.

### QueueProcessingStrategy

The `QueueProcessingStrategy` class is responsible for determining the best move for a given position. It uses the pgnAnalyzer and baseProvider to determine the best move.

### RequestProcessor

The `RequestProcessor` class is responsible for handling requests from clients. It uses the baseManager, queueProcessor, usageStatistics, and analyzer to process requests.

### Analyzer

The `Analyzer` module is responsible for analyzing positions and providing analysis results. It uses the ricpaClient and pingUrl to send and receive data from the Ricpa engine.

### BaseManager

The `BaseManager` module is responsible for managing the chessbase. It provides methods for reading, indexing, and optimizing the chessbase.

### DepthSelector

The `DepthSelector` module is responsible for setting the default depth for analysis.

### PgnAnalyzer

The `PgnAnalyzer` module is responsible for analyzing PGN files and determining the best move for a given position.

### Queue

The `Queue` module is responsible for managing the analysis queue. It provides methods for adding, removing, and retrieving items from the queue.

### Synchronizer

The `Synchronizer` module is responsible for saving and loading the analysis queue.

### UsageStatistics

The `UsageStatistics` module is responsible for tracking usage statistics. It provides methods for loading and saving usage statistics.

### UsageStatisticsSynchronizer

The `UsageStatisticsSynchronizer` module is responsible for synchronizing usage statistics with the server.

### API

The `API` module is responsible for registering the request processor and setting the port for the server.
