## Project Overview

The Chess Analysis Tool is a software application designed to analyze chess positions and provide insights and recommendations for players. It connects to the Ricpa chess engine and utilizes various modules and classes to process analysis requests, manage the analysis queue, and provide accurate evaluations.

The main features of the Chess Analysis Tool include:
- Connecting to the Ricpa chess engine for analysis
- Processing analysis requests and providing evaluation results
- Managing the analysis queue and prioritizing positions for analysis
- Analyzing PGN files and determining the best move for a given position
- Tracking usage statistics and synchronizing them with the server
