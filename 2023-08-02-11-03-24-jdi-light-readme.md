## Project Overview

The JDI Light Framework is a powerful and flexible automation framework for Java-based web applications. It provides a set of tools and utilities to simplify the process of creating and maintaining automated tests. The framework is designed to be easy to use, yet highly customizable, allowing developers to write tests in a concise and expressive manner.

Some key features of the JDI Light Framework include:

- Page Object Model (POM) support: The framework encourages the use of the POM design pattern, making it easy to create and manage page objects.
- Built-in test data management: The framework provides a convenient way to manage test data, allowing you to easily create and use test data sets.
- Extensive element interaction capabilities: The framework provides a rich set of methods for interacting with web elements, including clicking, typing, selecting, and more.
- Powerful logging and reporting: The framework integrates with Allure Reporting, providing detailed and customizable reports for test execution results.

## Installation

To install and set up the JDI Light Framework, follow these steps:

1. Clone the project repository from GitHub.
2. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE.
3. Install any necessary dependencies or prerequisites, such as Selenium WebDriver and TestNG.
4. Configure the JDI Light framework settings in the `JDISettings` class. This includes settings for common, log, timeouts, driver, element, page, and screen configurations.
5. Create your test classes and page objects using the framework's conventions and guidelines.

## Usage

To use the JDI Light Framework, follow these guidelines:

1. Create a new test class and extend the `BaseTest` class provided by the framework.
2. Use the `@Test` annotation to mark your test methods.
3. Use the framework's APIs to interact with web elements and perform actions.
4. Use the framework's built-in test data management capabilities to provide test data inputs.
5. Use the `@JDebug` annotation to mark methods or classes for debugging purposes.
6. Run your tests using your preferred test runner or IDE.

Here's an example of a test method using the JDI Light Framework:

```java
@Test
public void loginTest() {
    LoginPage loginPage = new LoginPage();
    loginPage.open();
    loginPage.login("username", "password");
    Assert.assertTrue(loginPage.isLoggedIn());
}
```
