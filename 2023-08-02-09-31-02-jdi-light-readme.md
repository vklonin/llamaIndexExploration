## Project Overview

The JDI Light framework is a library of classes and methods that allow developers to create automated tests for web applications. It provides a set of tools and utilities to simplify the process of writing and executing tests, making it easier to ensure the quality and reliability of web applications.

The main features of the JDI Light framework include:

- Representation of UI elements: The framework provides classes to represent different types of UI elements, such as buttons, input fields, dropdowns, and menus. These classes offer methods for interacting with the elements, such as clicking, entering text, and selecting options.

- Page object model: The framework follows the page object model design pattern, which promotes the creation of reusable and maintainable test code. Each web page is represented by a separate class, which encapsulates the page's elements and provides methods for interacting with them.

- Annotation-based element identification: The framework allows developers to identify UI elements on web pages using annotations. This simplifies the process of locating and interacting with elements, as developers can use familiar CSS selectors or custom UI locators.

- Easy setup and configuration: The framework provides step-by-step instructions for installation and setup, making it easy for developers to get started with writing automated tests. It also includes support for popular web browsers and frameworks, ensuring compatibility with a wide range of web applications.

## Installation

To install and set up the JDI Light framework, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies by running the command `npm install`.
3. Configure the framework by editing the `config.js` file. Specify the desired browser and other settings according to your testing environment.
4. Run the command `npm test` to execute the sample tests included with the framework. This will verify that the installation was successful.

## Usage

To use the JDI Light framework in your own project, follow these guidelines:

1. Create a new test file or modify an existing one.
2. Import the necessary classes from the framework, such as `UIElement`, `JList`, `Menu`, `Form`, etc.
3. Use the imported classes to interact with the UI elements on the web page. Refer to the documentation and code examples for each class to understand their usage and available methods.
4. Write your test logic using the framework's classes and methods. Use assertions to verify the expected behavior of the web application.
5. Run your tests using a test runner, such as Mocha or Jest, to execute the tests and generate test reports.

Here is an example of how to interact with a UI element using the JDI Light framework:

```javascript
import { UIElement } from 'jdi-light-framework';

const submitButton = new UIElement('#submit-button');

submitButton.click();
```

This example creates a new `UIElement` instance representing a submit button on a web page. The `click()` method is then called on the element to simulate a user clicking the button.

For more examples and detailed usage instructions, refer to the documentation provided with the framework.
