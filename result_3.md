## Project Overview

The Chess Analysis Tool is a software application designed to analyze chess positions and provide insights and recommendations for players. It utilizes the Ricpa chess engine to perform the analysis and offers various features to enhance the user's understanding of the game.

Main features of the Chess Analysis Tool include:
- Ability to analyze chess positions and provide analysis results
- Support for reading and analyzing PGN (Portable Game Notation) files
- Management of an analysis queue to process multiple positions
- Tracking of usage statistics to monitor the tool's performance and usage patterns

## Installation

To install and set up the Chess Analysis Tool, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository from GitHub:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/username/chess-analysis-tool.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   cd chess-analysis-tool
   npm install
   ```

3. Configure the tool by updating the configuration file `config.js` with the necessary settings.

4. Start the application:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

5. Access the tool through a web browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

The Chess Analysis Tool provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with the application. Here are some examples of how to use the tool:

1. Analyzing a Chess Position:
   - Enter a FEN (Forsythâ€“Edwards Notation) string representing the chess position.
   - Click on the "Analyze" button to initiate the analysis.
   - The tool will provide analysis results, including the best move and evaluation of the position.

2. Analyzing a PGN File:
   - Upload a PGN file using the provided file input field.
   - Click on the "Analyze PGN" button to start the analysis.
   - The tool will process the PGN file and display the best move for each position.

3. Managing the Analysis Queue:
   - Add positions to the analysis queue by entering FEN strings or uploading PGN files.
   - Click on the "Process Queue" button to start processing the queued positions.
   - The tool will analyze each position in the queue and provide the results.

For more detailed instructions and examples, refer to the user documentation provided with the tool.

## Project Classes

### RicpaClient

The `RicpaClient` class is used to connect to the Ricpa chess engine. It provides methods for sending and receiving data from the engine.

### QueueProcessor

The `QueueProcessor` class is responsible for processing the analysis queue. It uses the evaluation, evaluationSources, analyzer, and strategy to process the queue.

### ExternalEvaluation

The `ExternalEvaluation` class is used to read and store external evaluations from a file.

### QueueProcessingStrategy

The `QueueProcessingStrategy` class is responsible for determining the best move for a given position. It uses the pgnAnalyzer and baseProvider to determine the best move.

### RequestProcessor

The `RequestProcessor` class is responsible for handling requests from clients. It uses the baseManager, queueProcessor, usageStatistics, and analyzer to process requests.

### Analyzer

The `Analyzer` module is responsible for analyzing positions and providing analysis results. It uses the ricpaClient and pingUrl to send and receive data from the Ricpa engine.

### BaseManager

The `BaseManager` module is responsible for managing the chessbase. It provides methods for reading, indexing, and optimizing the chessbase.

### DepthSelector

The `DepthSelector` module is responsible for setting the default depth for analysis.

### PgnAnalyzer

The `PgnAnalyzer` module is responsible for analyzing PGN files and determining the best move for a given position.

### Queue

The `Queue` module is responsible for managing the analysis queue. It provides methods for adding, removing, and retrieving items from the queue.

### Synchronizer

The `Synchronizer` module is responsible for saving and loading the analysis queue.

### UsageStatistics

The `UsageStatistics` module is responsible for tracking usage statistics. It provides methods for loading and saving usage statistics.

### UsageStatisticsSynchronizer

The `UsageStatisticsSynchronizer` module is responsible for synchronizing usage statistics with the server.

### API

The `API` module is responsible for registering the request processor and setting the port for the server.
