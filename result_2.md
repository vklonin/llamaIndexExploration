## Project Overview

The Chess Analysis Tool is a software application designed to analyze chess positions and provide insights and recommendations for players. It utilizes the Ricpa chess engine to perform the analysis and offers various features to enhance the user's understanding of the game.

Main features of the Chess Analysis Tool include:
- Connecting to the Ricpa chess engine to send and receive data
- Processing an analysis queue to analyze multiple positions
- Reading and storing external evaluations from a file
- Determining the best move for a given position
- Handling requests from clients and processing them accordingly
- Analyzing PGN files and determining the best move for each position
- Managing the analysis queue by adding, removing, and retrieving items
- Managing the chessbase by reading, indexing, and optimizing it
- Setting the default depth for analysis
- Tracking usage statistics and synchronizing them with the server
